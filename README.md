## Requirements
* Python version >= 3.6
* Pytorch version = 1.2

## Running and Training
We provide pre-trained models for French and Spanish in the `models` folder.
All input files should be in conllu format.

In order to run a pretrained model, use the command.
```bash
python src/main.py --in_files [input conllu files] --psi [path to psi .pt file] --reinflect [path to reinflectino model] --animate_list [path to animacy list] --inc_input --get_ids  --out_file [path to output_file] --part 100
```
In order to train the model, use the following command
```bash
python src/neural-mrf.py --data [path to training data] --out_dir [path to output directory]--log_alpha 1 --lr 0.005 --wd 0.0001
```
You can train the reinflection using `reinflection_train.py`.
